Revelation is an instant action. It can be undertaken when a [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] first encounters a Mystery, revealing only the surface information (see p. 94), and also when a [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] has unraveledsome or all of the Mystery’s [[Rules/Opacity\|Opacity]].
**Dice Pool**: Gnosis + Arcanum – [[Rules/Opacity\|Opacity]]
**Action**: Instant
### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure**: The player overloads her own perceptions and the subject of her study with Mana, akin to spilling a bottle of ink on a page she was deciphering. No [[Rules/Scrutiny\|Scrutiny]] or Revelation of that subject is possible — by any [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] — for the next 24 hours. The Prime spell “Cleanse Pattern” can dissolve the Mana before then, allowing further [[Rules/Scrutiny\|Scrutiny]].
**Failure**: The [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] is unable to Reveal anything about the subject. She can still attempt to Scrutinize it, however.
**Success**: The [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] discovers the surface information (p. 94) of the Mystery.
**Exceptional Success**: The [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] discovers the surface information of the Mystery and can either lower the Mystery’s [[Rules/Opacity\|Opacity]] rating by 1, or, at the Storyteller’s discretion, uncover one piece of deep information.
