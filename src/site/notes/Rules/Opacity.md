Setting the Opacity rating for a given Mystery is in the Storyteller’s hands. It isn’t something that should have a hard-and-fast formula to it, because if the players figure out that having Opacity 4 always means a four-dot spell is in effect, it lessens the impact of solving the Mystery. With that said, here are some guidelines for the Storyteller:

- The higher the Arcana, the higher the Opacity: A decent rule of thumb is for Opacity to be rated equal to the highest Arcanum used in a spell, as a base. This means that a [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] should be able Scrutinize a one-dot spell in a single turn, but that’s appropriate; such spells aren’t terribly involved. That said….
- Complexity increases Opacity: A spell that involves five different Arcana all at one dot would certainly have a higher Opacity than a single-Arcanum spell. Increase Opacity by one per extra Arcanum used.
- Remember the Math: An Opacity 4 Mystery doesn’t take four successes to unravel. It takes 10 (four to drop it to Opacity 3, three more to drop it to Opacity 2, and soon). An Opacity 6 Mystery requires 21 successes to fully unravel. Think very carefully before assigning Opacity ratings higher than 5.
- [[NPCs/Awakened\|Mages]] can cloak their magic: Hiding a Mystery from [[Rules/Scrutiny\|Scrutiny]] is part and parcel to the [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]]. They layer “decoy” spells on top of Mysteries, use Prime to send would-be Scrutinizers down false paths, and set traps for careless investigators. You can represent these things with high Opacity, and set the “truth” at the deeper levels of the Mystery.
- Non-Supernal Phenomena Are More Opaque: A [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] can Scrutinize the site of a Wasteland created by a Promethean and learn a great deal, but the Opacity rating should be higher (roughly 1.5 times higher, as a suggestion) than a similar effect created by [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]] magic.
- Opacity is assigned for each character, and reduced separately by [[Rules/Scrutiny\|Scrutiny]]
