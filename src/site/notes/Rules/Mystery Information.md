# Surface Information
- Whether the Mystery is the result of [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]] magic.
- If so, what Arcana were involved
- Signature Nimbus of the caster (unless it was cast using a Rote).
- Roughly how old the Mystery is (hours, days, months, years, centuries).

# Deep Information
- If [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]] magic cast using a Rote, or the effects of an Attainment, the Signature Nimbus of the [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] involved.
- For [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]] spells, the spell factors involved (including the remaining duration), whether the spell caused a Paradox (and if so whether that Paradox was released or contained), and whether the spell has been relinquished.
- Identification of a phenomenon as being linked to one the [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]] has Scrutinized before.
- If not [[NPCs/Awakened\|Awakened]] magic, the power level of the creator relative to the [[NPCs/Awakened\|mage]]’s Gnosis (if applicable).
- Whether the Mystery is related to the Supernal Realms or Abyss.
- How the Arcanum used relates to the Mystery — for example, using Death Sight to scrutinize a vampire’s ghoul will reveal Deep Information relating to the undead blood in the subject’s system, and any powers the ghoul has gained from it. Using Fate Sight to assess a changeling’s powers will reveal that they are formed by mystical bargains.
